\section{Conclusion}
In this report we have provided a brief overview of the PRIAM methodology. Additionally we took a more detailed look at \textit{privacy harms} in the context of a medical breach. For that purpose we presented a case study for the UCLA Health breach. The results of the study have shown that PRIAM can be applied to medical breaches to get a meaningful understanding of the consequences and gravity of \textit{privacy harms}. We have shown further, that the approach can be extended to get relative information about the impact of different categories of \textit{privacy harms} in medical breaches.
