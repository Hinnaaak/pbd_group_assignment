\section{Discussion}
In the last section we took a look at the privacy harms that resulted from a hacking incident at UCLA Health. In this section, we will examine the results more closely and provide a discussion about the information one can gain from the PRIAM analysis.\\
In our example, we can observe that the \textit{victim} attribtute is most often estimated as \textit{Low}, while the \textit{intensity} is almost always scaled as \textit{High}. An important factor in the scaling was the difficult to impossible reversibility for most harms, as once data is disclosed it can not be undisclosed. This leads to the \textit{severity} of each harm being almost exclusively rated as either \textit{Significant} or \textit{Maximum}.\\
TO ADD: 2nd paper, impact of each harm category
